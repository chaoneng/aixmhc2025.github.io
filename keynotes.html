				<strong>Title: Using large scale genomic data to define immune mechanisms of complex autoimmune disease</strong><br>
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Rheumatoid arthritis is a canonical autoimmune disease, affecting up to 1% of the population. It is associated with autoantibodies and causes a chronic inflammatory arthritis leading to pain, disability and a reduction in lifespan. To define mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis, we and others have used multiple strategies, and have sought to define key human mechanisms. Using human genetics, we and others have identified ~150 risk alleles in addition to those within the HLA. To define disease mechanisms, we have used single-cell data and tissue imaging data to define key cell states in the context of tissue inflammation. Finally, we have used functional genomics approaches, including single-cell RNA-seq data, single-cell ATAC-seq data, and gene-editing to define disease mechanisms relevant to these key cell states. Each of these analyses relies heavily on computational methods, including those that use artificial intelligence strategies. Successful definition of key mechanisms may lead to novel therapeutics, and potentially a cure.<br>

				<strong>Title: AI for genomic medicine: disease circuitry, patient heterogeneity, therapeutic design</strong><br>
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk I will describe the latest advances in AI for healthcare, medicine, biology, therapeutic design, and pharmaceutical development. We have witnessed a dramatic transformation in AI technologies beyond simply prediction, classification, and correlation to foundational models for understanding biological function, chemical structure, and disease states. In this talk I will describe the foundational technologies that power these advances, and our own work in understanding the mechanistic basis of human disease, using this knowledge to identify new targets and design new therapeutics that reverse disease circuitry, using machine learning to integrate genetics and genomics, single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics, and high-throughput experiments. I will describe our work in six areas: (1) Genomes, their programming language, their circuitry, epigenomics, dynamics, single-cell multi-omics. (2) Disease mechanism, genetic variation, patient subtyping, personalized medicine, electronic health records. (3) Application to neuroscience, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancer, evolution. (4) Therapeutic design, drug repurposing, high-throughput experiments, drug screening, genome circuitry manipulation, disease reversal. (5) Statistical genetics, causal inference, geometric deep learning, joint embeddings, contrastive learning, computational chemistry, therapeutic design. (6) Embedding space idea representations, visualization, and navigation for learning, discovery, invention, and collaboration.<br>

				<strong>Title: Development of YOLOv4, YOLOv7, and YOLOv9</strong><br>
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> YOLOv4 has been ranked first in the world object detection competition for two and a half months. It defeated the R&D teams of international companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Qualcomm.  The birth of YOLOv4 is actually closely related to a project "Development of Smart Transportation System."
				This project is funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, and it has led to a four-year cooperative relationship between the Academia Sinica and the listed company Elan Electronics. This keynote speech will explain in detail the beginning and end of the implementation of this smart transportation project, and how to develop YOLOv4, the fastest and most accurate object detector in the world during the execution of the project. In Addition, I will also introduce YOLOv7 and YOLOv9, that were developed by our team in 2022 and early 2024, respectively.  These YOLO series real-time object detection systems developed in Taiwan continue to lead the world stage and strive for supreme glory for Taiwan.<br>
